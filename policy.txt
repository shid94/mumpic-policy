Demographic Information.
We may collect and store demographic information (such as your zip code, gender, location and age), and use this data to tailor your experience on our websites, ensure you are at least 18 years of age to make purchases, provide content that we think you might be interested in, perform general improvements to the Websites, Mobile Apps, and display the content according to your preferences. Such demographic information may be shared with partners, market researchers and other third parties on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable basis. No personally identifiable information will be linked to such aggregated demographic information that is shared with third parties.

Location Data
Our app does not actively collect or use location data in the background. However, certain third-party services integrated into the app — such as analytics, content delivery networks, and authentication providers (including Firebase, Google Sign-In and Branch.io) may request access to location or other sensitive data to function properly or for analytics purposes.
We do not use background location access as part of the core functionality of the app. If background location permissions are requested, they are not required for the primary streaming features and will be removed if found unnecessary.

If you have any questions about how long we will keep your specific data, please contact privacy@mumpic.com
Who We Share Your Personal Data with.
We provide your personal data to companies that help us with our business activities (e.g. assisting us in Mobile Apps and Site operations, providing customer service, etc.) or that assist us in improving our products, content, services or advertising. These companies are authorized to use your personal data only as necessary to provide these services.

We will also share your personal data:
•	When we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government request. This includes exchanging information with law enforcement, other companies and organizations for fraud protection, credit risk reduction or other similar purposes;
•	In connection with a corporate change including a merger, acquisition, transfer or sale of assets or in connection to insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership. Information about our users, including customer information, will also need to be disclosed to our legal and financial advisors, investors or potential buyer in some commercial transactions seeking financing, investment or support or funding;

A list of our companies is included here including their vendors, suppliers, contractors and agents, which may be involved in the provision of the Website or the content, so that we can better serve you or, simply, to give response to your requests (e.g. when you use contact us forms).

Where we transfer your personal information.
If you utilize our Services from a country other than the country where our servers are located, your personal information may be transferred across international borders, which will only be done when necessary for the performance of our contract with you, when we have your consent to do so, or subject to the appropriate standard contractual clauses. Also, when you call us or initiate a chat, we may provide you with support from one of our global locations outside your country of origin.

How we secure, store and retain your data.
We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal information we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate. We work to protect the security of your financial information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) software, which encrypts the information you input on the Site. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You can further help to ensure your security by taking a few simple precautions. For instance, it is important to protect against unauthorized access to your computer and to any Mumpic username and password, and to be sure to sign off when you are finished using a shared computer.

We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have requested and thereafter for a variety of legitimate legal or business purposes. These might include retention periods:
•	mandated by law, contract or similar obligations applicable to our business operations;
•	for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or
•	needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.
